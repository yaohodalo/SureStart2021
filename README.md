# SureStart2021
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Training program with SureStart Spring 2021.
This repository is for the SureStart training program in AI & Machine Learning Spring 2021 cohort. In the first phase of this program, we will learn AI skills through a curated, interest-led, self-paced curriculum, accessed virtually with the support of a group of experienced mentors.

## Day 1 (02/08/2021): Welcome Spring Cohort
Today was the opening session for the training program. I learned about the program in general and all the expectations for this training. I also learned how important it is to ask open-ended questions starting with "tell me..." allowing your interlocutor to explore and provide different ideas. 

## Day 2 (02/09/2021): INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING (ML) AND SCIKIT-LEARN
In today's learning, I was introduce to Machine Learning: what is it, why do we use it and types of Machine Learning systems.
#### 1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
The difference is that supervised learning focuses on pre-defined set of training examples to be able to reach an acurrate conclusion when given a new data. It is mostly used in predictions. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervized learning focuses on finding patterns and correlations in a bunch of data sets. 
#### 2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
This statement is false because Scikit-Learn was built on top of all those several data analysis libraries.

## Day 3 (02/10/2021): INTRODUCTION TO ML AND TENSORFLOW
I learned how to use Trensorflow Library and Keras Library. In my previous work I was using Jupyter Notebook in this one I am using Google Colab. 
#### 1. What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
Tensors are multidimensional data arrays implemented in Tensorflow. They are the mathematical representation of a physical entity that may be characterized by magnitude and multiple directions. They are used to construct neural network in ML

#### 2. What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?

## Day 4 (02/11/2021): WHAT IS DEEP LEARNING?
In this session, I learned what is Deep Learning, the difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning, the advantages of Deep Learning and Problems related to it. I also learned how deep learning is used in real-world problems. It was instructive to know that Netflix, LTSM and speech recognition tools like Siri, Alexa ... are buit from DL. 

#### Think about a real-world problem and see if you can find a dataset that has the characteristics of the data of that problem. Then, think about the deep learning algorithm that you would likely use to develop a solution to it. Outline why you picked a particular approach.
Cancer has been the main cause of mortality and mordibity in the world. A disease that in most cases is diagnosed in its late stages. The use of Deep Learning can help detect early cancer. I found a data set from Darmouth Atlas Project that has a large data of cancer deaths in the US from 2003 to 2012: https://query.data.world/s/hcgrhfgd7usebhntswn7rq2panz63s . 
Thinking about a deep learning algorithm, pattern recognition might be helpful to look at all the cases, detect common causes, sympthoms, imagerie results to get accurate results on how to detect early cancer cells. 

## Day 5 (02/12/2021): WHAT ARE NEURAL NETWORKS (NN)?
In this session, I had a deep understanding of Neural Networks, what are they, what types are they and how to build one. Check my project to see a code 

## Day 8 (02/15/2021): INTRODUCTION TO CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS)
In this session, I extended the training data using the full training data from this MNIST Database. Check the code in project file

## Day 9 (02/16/2021): ALGORITHMIC BIAS AND DATA SETS
1. How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game?
I think the AI concepts were used in designing the players patterns and in the bias process of hiring
2. Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable? 
One example of real-world biased machine learnig model is the algorithm hiring process of Amazon. Due to the fact that the human hiring process is already biased, the AI hiring is just repeating the process that already exist. To make this model fair, they need change their human hiring process and then recreate their model in a way that it can follow the new process. 

## Day 10 (02/17/2021): NEURAL NETWORK LAYERS
Succinctly list the differences between a Convolutional Neural Network and a Fully Connected Neural Network. Discuss layers and their role, and applications of each of the two types of architectures: 
- Convolutional Neural Network focuses on image recongnition and analysis, while Fully Connected Neural Network consists of a series of fully connected layers that connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the other layer. 
- The layers are different from the CNN and FCNN. Convolutional layer plays a role of filter by scanning pixels at a time. The Fully Connected input layer flattens the previous layers and turns them into a single vector. The Fully connected output layer gives final probabilities of each label

## Day 11 (02/18/2021): - NEURAL NETWORK PRACTICE WITH MNIST DIGITS
Check the code for CNN classifying MNIST datasets.

## Day 12 (02/19/2021): - IMAGE CLASSIFICATION AND ML
Check the code on image classification model.

## Day 15 (02/22/2021): ETHICS-DRIVEN ML PRACTICE
Check the code on gender classification model. 

## Day 16 (02/23/2021): ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS
1. Advantages of the Rectified Linear activation function, along with one use case: 
Relu : not vanishing gradient, More computationally efficient to compute than Sigmoid like functions since Relu just needs to pick max(0,x) and not perform expensive exponential operations as in Sigmoid, networks with Relu tend to show better convergence performance than sigmoid.

## Day 17 (02/24/2021): - LOSS FUNCTIONS
Check code on Predict house prices using a simple CNN model using this dataset.

## Day 18 (02/25/2021): DATA OVERFITTING AND REGULARIZATION
Check the code on the hands-on sentiment analysis tutorial.
 
## Day 19 (02/26/2021): UPSAMPLING AND AUTOENCODERS
Check the code on the interactive tutorials

## Day 22 (03/01/2021): NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)
Check the code for the NLP model
