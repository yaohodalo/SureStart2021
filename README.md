# SureStart2021
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Training program with SureStart Spring 2021.
This repository is for the SureStart training program in AI & Machine Learning Spring 2021 cohort. In the first phase of this program, we will learn AI skills through a curated, interest-led, self-paced curriculum, accessed virtually with the support of a group of experienced mentors.

## Day 1 (02/08/2021): Welcome Spring Cohort
Today was the opening session for the training program. I learned about the program in general and all the expectations for this training. I also learned how important it is to ask open-ended questions starting with "tell me..." allowing your interlocutor to explore and provide different ideas. 

## Day 2 (02/09/2021): INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING (ML) AND SCIKIT-LEARN
In today's learning, I was introduce to Machine Learning: what is it, why do we use it and types of Machine Learning systems.
#### 1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
The difference is that supervised learning focuses on pre-defined set of training examples to be able to reach an acurrate conclusion when given a new data. It is mostly used in predictions. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervized learning focuses on finding patterns and correlations in a bunch of data sets. 
#### 2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
This statement is false because Scikit-Learn was built on top of all those several data analysis libraries.

## Day 3 (02/10/2021): INTRODUCTION TO ML AND TENSORFLOW
I learned how to use Trensorflow Library and Keras Library. In my previous work I was using Jupyter Notebook in this one I am using Google Colab. 
#### 1. What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
Tensors are multidimensional data arrays implemented in Tensorflow. They are the mathematical representation of a physical entity that may be characterized by magnitude and multiple directions. They are used to construct neural network in ML

#### 2. What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?

## Day 4 (02/11/2021): WHAT IS DEEP LEARNING?
In this session, I learned what is Deep Learning, the difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning, the advantages of Deep Learning and Problems related to it. I also learned how deep learning is used in real-world problems. It was instructive to know that Netflix, LTSM and speech recognition tools like Siri, Alexa ... are buit from DL. 

#### Think about a real-world problem and see if you can find a dataset that has the characteristics of the data of that problem. Then, think about the deep learning algorithm that you would likely use to develop a solution to it. Outline why you picked a particular approach.
Cancer has been the main cause of mortality and mordibity in the world. A disease that in most cases is diagnosed in its late stages. The use of Deep Learning can help detect early cancer. I found a data set from Darmouth Atlas Project that has a large data of cancer deaths in the US from 2003 to 2012: https://query.data.world/s/hcgrhfgd7usebhntswn7rq2panz63s . 
Thinking about a deep learning algorithm, pattern recognition might be helpful to look at all the cases, detect common causes, sympthoms, imagerie results to get accurate results on how to detect early cancer cells. 

## Day 5 (02/12/2021): WHAT ARE NEURAL NETWORKS (NN)?
In this session, I had a deep understanding of Neural Networks, what are they, what types are they and how to build one. Check my project to see a code
