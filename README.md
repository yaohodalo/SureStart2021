## Day 1 (02/08/2021): Welcome Spring Cohort
Today was the opening session for the training program. I learned about the program in general and all the expectations for this training. I also learned how important it is to ask open-ended questions starting with "tell me..." allowing your interlocutor to explore and provide different ideas. 

## Day 2 (02/09/2021): INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING (ML) AND SCIKIT-LEARN
In today's learning, I was introduce to Machine Learning: what is it, why do we use it and types of Machine Learning systems.
#### 1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
The difference is that supervised learning focuses on pre-defined set of training examples to be able to reach an acurrate conclusion when given a new data. It is mostly used in predictions. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervized learning focuses on finding patterns and correlations in a bunch of data sets. 
#### 2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
This statement is false because Scikit-Learn was built on top of all those several data analysis libraries
